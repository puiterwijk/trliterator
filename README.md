Trans Literator (replacement with tables)

## Tables
Table files are stored in *tables/* (Still hardcoded, needs fixing!)  
Every line contains a replacement pair separated by **one** empty space  
"x y" (where every "x" will be replaced with "y")  
Table files support comments, every line which starts with **'#'** is a comment,  
 and will be ignored.
